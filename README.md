![AI POSTER](https://github.com/ricky11/Poster-AI/blob/352528957daa9b3133a4aa1fefe92066d8745046/POSTER%20-%20AI.png)

## KEY POINTS
- AI spending by retailers will reach $12b by 2023
- Our agents are equipped with natural language processing
- Each AI Robot agent can sense surroundings with computer vision
- Push customized notifications based on consumer interactions, creating a more cohesive mall experience.
- Anomaly detection can analyze video of suspicious behavior,
- Embedded Sensors with Computer vision
- Learning with human feedback (RLHF) improves accuracy over time
-

## Conclusions
Massive benefits are evident in AI-assisted agents that have considerable benefits to consumers. However, a balanced weighting must be found to mitigate the unintended consequences.
